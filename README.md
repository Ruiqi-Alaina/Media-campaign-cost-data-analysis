# Media-campaign-cost-data-analysis
Median campaign cost data from Kaggle gives information about the cost of media campaigns in the food marts in the United States on the basis of the features provided.
The full description of the dataset could be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/media-campaign-cost-prediction). 
Two datasets(train/test) will be included in this repository. SQL, tableau and python/R will be used for data analysis. The training dataset will be used for data exploration and cleaning in SQL and data visualization in Tableau dashboard. Statistical Model will be built based on the training dataset in Python or R.
